# Browsertrix Behaviors Tutorial

This is an introduction to writing new behaviors for the Browsertrix crawler
and extension. Behaviors range from a variety of usecases, such as automatically
scrolling through the page to load more content, clicking through UI elements
that open pop-ups, modals, and sidebars‚Äì or performing specific actions on
social media sites or other non-conventional websites, specifically Single Page
Applications (SPAs).

# Writing a TikTok Video Behavior

We're going to write a TikTok video behavior that scrolls through and expands
each comment thread.

## üèó  Scaffolding

To create a new behavior, we first create a new file in the `src/site/`
directory. This will define a JavaScript module that extends the `Behavior`
class as well as a `Symbol.asyncIterator` function that acts as the "entry" to
the behavior's actions.

We'll name our file `tiktok.js` and add the basic elements needed to define
our behavior:

```javascript
/* src/site/tiktok.js */
import { Behavior } from "../lib/behavior";

class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

The next step we need to take is to include our new behavior into the
`src/site/index.js` module, like so:

```javascript
/* Other video behaviors */
import { TikTokVideoBehavior } from "./tiktok";

const siteBehaviors = [
  /* Other video behaviors */
  TikTokVideoBehavior,
];

export default siteBehaviors;
```

### The `isMatch()` method

Next we define an `isMatch` method for our `TikTokVideoBehavior` class. This
method checks whether the behavior should run on the current page. Let's use a
regular expression to match against the current path:

```javascript
class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  static isMatch() {
    const pathRegex = /https:\/\/(www\.)?tiktok\.com\/@.+\/video\/\d+/;
    return window.location.href.match(pathRegex);
  }
}
```

Note that the `isMatch` method is `static`, meaning it is defined on the class
itself. When this function returns true, our code in the `Symbol.asyncIterator`
method will run.

### Finding each comment thread

We're now ready to run behaviors on TikTok video pages. browsertrix-behaviors
relies on [XPath][xpath] queries to find DOM nodes and interact with them.
After looking through the page's HTML, you'll see that the comment threads all
live inside an element whose classname corresponds with its element type
followed by `CommentListContainer`.

[xpath]: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp

An XPath query that looks for `div` elements with a similar class, looks
something like this:

```
//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]
```

Let's define a constant to reference these queries:

```javascript
const Q = {
  commentListContainer: "//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]",
}
```

In order to find an element via XPath, we import a function from the
`src/lib/utils.js` module:

Next, we expand the `Symbol.asyncIterator` method like so:

```javascript
class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    console.log("[LOG] List Container", commentList);
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

For now we're just logging out the result returned by the query.

## üè≥  Checkpoint: Testing our code so far

Let's test the pieces we've built so far in the browser. At this point your
`src/site/tiktok.js` module should look something like this:

```javascript
import { Behavior } from "../lib/behavior";
import { xpathNode } from "../lib/utils";

const Q = {
  commentListContainer: "//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]"
};

export const BREADTH_ALL = Symbol("BREADTH_ALL");

export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  static get name() {
    return "TikTokVideo";
  }

  static isMatch() {
    const pathRegex = /https:\/\/(www\.)?tiktok\.com\/@.+\/video\/\d+/;
    return window.location.href.match(pathRegex);
  }

  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    console.log("[LOG] List Container", commentList);
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

We'll build what we have so far via the `build-dev` script defined in
`package.json`. Make sure you have `yarn` installed as well as the project's
dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install -g yarn
$ yarn install
```

Next, we build our behaviors in development mode:

```
$ yarn run build-dev
```

This will compile and output our behaviors into `dist/behaviors.js`. We can
copy this code and run it in our browser to test behaviors directly. Make sure
you're viewing a [TikTok Video][tiktok-video], and we can test our code in
Chrome for example by following these steps:

[tiktok-video]: https://www.tiktok.com/@webbstyles/video/7143026261693123882

>
> _**TODO:** Record video outlining this process_
>

1. Open the Developer Tools
1. Click the `Sources` tab
1. In the left sidebar, open the `Snippets` tab
1. Click the `+ New Snippet` button
1. Build the development output via `yarn run build-dev`
1. Copy the output from `dist/index.js`
    - Running `cat dist/index.js | pbcopy` on Linux/MacOS will copy the contents to your clipboard.
1. Paste the contents in the new Snippet
1. At the bottom of the window click the "Play" button or press `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`

Our code is now loaded into the browser, and we can interact with it directly.
In order to run our new behavior, open the `Console` tab in the Developer Tools
and run the following code:

```javascript
self.__bx_behaviors.run({
  autofetch: false,
  autoplay: false,
  autoscroll: false,
  siteSpecific: true
});
```

A few outputs should appear in your console that look like the following:

```
> {data: 'Starting Site-Specific Behavior: TikTokVideo', type: 'debug'}
> [LOG] List Container <div class="tiktok-...-DivCommentListContainer ...">‚Ä¶</div>
> {data: 'Waiting for behaviors to finish', type: 'debug'}
> {data: 'TikTok Video Behavior Complete', type: 'info'}
> {data: {state: {}, msg: 'done!'}, type: 'info'}
> {data: 'All Behaviors Done for https://www.tiktok.com/@webbstyles/video/7143026261693123882', type: 'debug'}
```

## ‚è¨ Scrolling through comments

Since we've identified the element containing the video's comemnts, we can now
write an XPath query that matches against them. This query is very similar to
the one we're using for the `commentListContainer`, with one notable difference:

```javascript
const Q = {
  commentListContainer: "//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]",
  commentItemContainer: "div[contains(@class, 'CommentItemContainer')]",
};
```

Note that there's no `//` prepended to this query, which is specifically used to
match against the _entire_ node structure recursively from the root. While this
is useful for identifying our `CommentListContainer`, it is less appropriate
when defining a query which needs to target specific nodes or‚Äî in the case of
the new `CommentItemContainer` query‚Äî is intended for a helper function that
utilizes it with other parameters.

### The `iterChildMatches` helper function

Let's now import the `iterChildMatches` function from our utils module:

```javascript
import { iterChildMatches, xpathNode } from "../lib/utils";
//       ^---- New import
```

This function takes a query just as `xpathNode` does, along with a parent node
that specifies where we'd like to search. The result is an iterator that looks
for the next element that matches the query and also _waits_ for a new one
before exhausting its search. This allows us to "infinitely scroll" if you will
by matching against both the existing elements and _potential ones_ that may
appear as a result of scrolling or other UI behaviors.

We can now generate this list and iterate through it using an async `for` loop:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      // ... do something with each comment
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

### Using `scrollIntoView`

Now that we're iterating through each comment, we can call the `scrollIntoView`
method to scroll through them. This method takes a set of options that the base
`Behavior` class provides for us:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

### Using `yield` and `this.getState`

We're now scrolling through our comments, but the `asyncIterator` we've written
for our behavior does not `yield` any results other than at the end when it has
completed. This can cause issues down the line, specifically for the
[ArchiveWeb.page][archivewebpage] extension which relies on the ability to pause
and resume site behaviors.

[archivewebpage]: https://github.com/webrecorder/archiveweb.page

Additionally, our behavior isn't logging any results or accumulating totals as
it crawls through the page. We can resolve this by using the `getState` method
defined in the `Behavior` base class:

```javascript
// in the async* [Symbol.asyncIterator] method
for await (const item of commentItems) {
  item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
  yield this.getState("View thread", "threads");
}
```

Our behavior now yields a result each time we scroll to a comment, and the
extension can now pause and resume the scrolling behavior.

## üìñ Expanding comment threads

Since we're able to identify each comment, we can now look for specific parts of
the element like buttons that perform actions on the page. Let's define a new
method called `expandThread`. This method will take a comment item and look for
the `View more replies` button, which we identify with the following query:

```javascript
const Q = {
  // ...
  viewMoreReplies: ".//p[contains(@class, 'ReplyActionText')]",
}
```

Next for our `expandThread Method`:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* expandThread(item) {
    const viewMore = xpathNode(Q.viewMoreReplies, item);
    if (!viewMore) return;
    // ... do something with the "View more repleis" button
  }
  // ...
}
```

As you can see, we've targeted the "View more replies" button with our query
using `xpathNode`; note that it also takes a "parent" argument that specifies
where to look. Our new method then checks whether or not the button exists
before continuing on. Let's import a handy function that will both scroll the
button into the view as well as click it after a provided amount of time:

```javascript
import { iterChildMatches, scrollAndClick, xpathNode } from "../lib/utils";
//                         ^---- New import
```

We can now use `scrollAndClick` in our new method as well as `this.getState` to
mark our progress:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* expandThread(item) {
    const viewMore = xpathNode(Q.viewMoreReplies, item);
    if (!viewMore) return;
    await scrollAndClick(viewMore, 500);
    yield this.getState("Expand thread", "expandedThreads");
  }
  // ...
}
```

Finally, let's add our new method to the `Symbol.asyncIterator` method:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
      yield* this.expandThread(item);
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

Note that we use the `yield*` keyword in order to yield each result of the
`expandThread` method one at a time. This maintains our fine-grained control
over pausing and resuming the behavior.

## üè≥  Checkpoint: Testing our behavior in ArchiveWeb.page

> Content pending...

## üîÅ Recursively expanding comment threads

So far only the initial "View more comments" button is clicked and the resulting
content is loaded, but in order to fully scrape entire videos' comment sections
we'll need to go beyond just loading one set of replies.

One tactic we can use is a recursive method that clicks the `View more` button
that appearsa when more comments are available to load in each thread after
initial expansion. There are a few things to consider:

1. The `View more` button doesn't exist until we've already clicked
   `View more replies`.
1. The button may not appear at all if the end of the thread has been reached.
1. Clicking the button once "destroys" it and once a new group of comments has
   loaded, a new button accompanies them.

### The `waitUntilNode` helper function

The main tool we'll use to alleviate some of these complexities is called
`waitUntilNode`:

```javascript
import { iterChildMatches, scrollAndClick, waitUntilNode, xpathNode } from "../lib/utils";
//                                         ^---- New import
```

Similar to our other query helper functions, `waitUntilNode` takes an XPath
query along with a parent node, but it returns a `Promise` as it waits for some
period of time before giving up on the query. It also accepts a third argument
that compares another node instance against what the query returns. This is
particularly needed for item 3 in the above list.

### Defining a `crawlThread` method

Let's add the last query we'll need to crawl comment threads, which targets the
`View more` buttons:

```javascript
const Q = {
  // ...
  viewMoreThread: ".//p[starts-with(@data-e2e, 'view-more')]"
};
```

Now we can define a `crawlThread` method that utilizes our new query as well as
the `waitUntilNode` function:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* crawlThread(parentNode, prev = null) {
    const next = await waitUntilNode(Q.viewMoreThread, parentNode, prev);
    if (!next) return;
  }
  // ...
}
```

Similarly to `expandThread` we exit the function if no button is found. We
added a `prev` argument to the method with a default value of `null`. This will
allow us to call the method recursively with our `next` node if it exists.

Let's complete our new method like so:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* crawlThread(parentNode, prev = null) {
    const next = await waitUntilNode(Q.viewMoreThread, parentNode, prev);
    if (!next) return;
    await scrollAndClick(next, 500);
    yield this.getState("View more replies", "replies");
    yield* this.crawlThread(parentNode, next);
  }
  // ...
}
```

Using recursion is the key to this method, as it relies on previous versions of
a similar node in order to iterate through the entirety of a comment thread.

There is a slight edge-case that can occur that we must account for, however. In
some instances, an element matching our `viewMoreThread` button will appear with
empty text. For our purposes, this indicates that there's either a delay in all
of the properties of new element appearing or that our thread has no more
replies to load. We can fix this by adding an additional logic check, but a more
elegant solution lies within our XPath query:

```javascript
const Q = {
  // ...
  viewMoreThread: ".//p[starts-with(@data-e2e, 'view-more') and string-length(text()) > 0]"
};
```

By using the `string-length(text())` function, we have access to the inner text
of our target element. Our query now ignores the edge-case when a blank button
appears on the page.

Lastly, our expandThread method needs to call our new crawling method after it's
finished expanding the first round of replies:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* expandThread(item) {
    const viewMore = xpathNode(Q.viewMoreReplies, item);
    if (!viewMore) return;
    await scrollAndClick(viewMore, 500);
    yield this.getState("Expand thread", "expandedThreads");
    yield* this.crawlThread(item, null);
    // ^ Begin crawling through additional replies
  }
  // ...
}
```

We pass `null` as our second argument to `crawlThread` in order to specify that
no previous element exists. This allows for the first `waitUntilNode` call to
return the first element matching our `viewMoreThread` query without checking
for a previous version of the element.

## üîå Defining behavior options

While passing options to our behavior through the extension isn't currently
available, we can both plan for that future functionality as well as allow code
that injects these behaviors to use them.

One example of a useful option is defining `breadth`, that is how many times
we'd like to expand each thread before moving on to the next. In some cases we
may want to see every reply, but for videos with a large number of comments it's
often more practical to only see a limited amount of top replies.

We'll define the `breadth` option one of two types:
- a number representing how many times we want to click the "more replies" button
- a symbol that tells the behavior to look through every reply

Since the latter option is how our behavior has worked all along, we'll define
it as a default when no `breadth` option is provided.

### The `setOpts` and `getOpts` methods

First let's define a symbol:

```javascript
export const BREADTH_ALL = Symbol("BREADTH_ALL");
```

Next, we modify our `constructor` class method:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  constructor({ breadth = BREADTH_ALL }) {
    super();
    this.setOpts({ breadth });
  }
  // ...
}
```

As we can see, our behavior expects all options to be passed as an object to the
class constructor. We then use the `setOpts` method included in the base class,
which stores our `breadth` option for later use.

Let's define a `breadthComplete` method that checks whether a number exceeds the
amount of iterations defined in our behavior's options:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  breadthComplete(iter) {
    const breadth = this.getOpt("breadth");
    return breadth !== BREADTH_ALL && breadth <= iter;
  }
  // ...
}
```

This method uses the corresponding `getOpts` method defined in the base class.

### Integrating `breadthComplete` into our behavior

We can now use our new helper method to check whether we want to expand any
threads at all in our `Symbol.asyncIterator` method:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
      yield this.getState("View thread", "threads");
      if (this.breadthComplete(0)) continue;
      // ^ Continue without expanding the thread if `breadth` is 0
      yield* this.expandThread(item);
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
  // ...
}
```

Next, we'll modify our `crawlThread` method:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* crawlThread(parentNode, prev = null, iter = 0) {
    const next = await waitUntilNode(Q.viewMoreThread, parentNode, prev);
    if (!next || this.breadthComplete(iter)) return;
    await scrollAndClick(next, 500);
    yield this.getState("View more replies", "replies");
    yield* this.crawlThread(parentNode, next, iter + 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

We've added a new extra `iter` parameter in order to track how many times we've
loaded new replies. This number is incremented on each recursive call.
Additionally, we check if `breadthComplete` is true when looking for our next
button.

Finally, the `expandThread` method needs to pass an initial `iter` parameter to
`crawlThread`. Since `expandThread` does load more replies, our initial number
is `1`:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* expandThread(item) {
    const viewMore = xpathNode(Q.viewMoreReplies, item);
    if (!viewMore) return;
    await scrollAndClick(viewMore, 500);
    yield this.getState("Expand thread", "expandedThreads");
    yield* this.crawlThread(item, null, 1);
  }
  // ...
}
```

## üèÅ Finishing up: Our TikTok video behavior

Congratulations! We've completed a working TikTok video behavior that iterates
through each thread and their replies. The final code looks something like this:

```javascript
import { Behavior } from "../lib/behavior";
import { iterChildMatches, scrollAndClick, waitUntilNode, xpathNode } from "../lib/utils";

const Q = {
  commentListContainer: "//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]",
  commentItemContainer: "div[contains(@class, 'CommentItemContainer')]",
  viewMoreReplies:      ".//p[contains(@class, 'ReplyActionText')]",
  viewMoreThread:       ".//p[starts-with(@data-e2e, 'view-more') and string-length(text()) > 0]"
};

export const BREADTH_ALL = Symbol("BREADTH_ALL");

export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  static get name() {
    return "TikTokVideo";
  }

  static isMatch() {
    const pathRegex = /https:\/\/(www\.)?tiktok\.com\/@.+\/video\/\d+/;
    return window.location.href.match(pathRegex);
  }

  constructor({ breadth = BREADTH_ALL }) {
    super();
    this.setOpts({ breadth });
  }

  breadthComplete(iter) {
    const breadth = this.getOpt("breadth");
    return breadth !== BREADTH_ALL && breadth <= iter;
  }

  async* crawlThread(parentNode, prev = null, iter = 0) {
    const next = await waitUntilNode(Q.viewMoreThread, parentNode, prev);
    if (!next || this.breadthComplete(iter)) return;
    await scrollAndClick(next, 500);
    yield this.getState("View more replies", "replies");
    yield* this.crawlThread(parentNode, next, iter + 1);
  }

  async* expandThread(item) {
    const viewMore = xpathNode(Q.viewMoreReplies, item);
    if (!viewMore) return;
    await scrollAndClick(viewMore, 500);
    yield this.getState("Expand thread", "expandedThreads");
    yield* this.crawlThread(item, null, 1);
  }

  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
      yield this.getState("View thread", "threads");
      if (this.breadthComplete(0)) continue;
      yield* this.expandThread(item);
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

In our first checkpoint we saw how to run our behavior on a webpage. We can also
include our new `breadth` option in this process in our console. To do so, we
pass an object instead of `true` to the `siteSpecific` option. We use the string
found in the static `name` method to reference our class:

```javascript
self.__bx_behaviors.run({
  autofetch: false,
  autoplay: false,
  autoscroll: false,
  siteSpecific: {
    TikTokVideo: { breadth: 3 }
  }
});
```

Running this code on a video page will now only expand threads three times
before moving on to the next.
