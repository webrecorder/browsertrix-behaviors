# Browsertrix Behaviors Tutorial

This is an introduction to writing new behaviors for the Browsertrix crawler
and extension. Behaviors range from a variety of usecases, such as automatically
scrolling through the page to load more content, clicking through UI elements
that open pop-ups, modals, and sidebars‚Äì or performing specific actions on
social media sites or other non-conventional websites, specifically Single Page
Applications (SPAs).

# Writing a TikTok Video Behavior

We're going to write a TikTok video behavior that scrolls through and expands
each comment thread.

## üèó  Scaffolding

To create a new behavior, we first create a new file in the `src/site/`
directory. This will define a JavaScript module that extends the `Behavior`
class as well as a `Symbol.asyncIterator` function that acts as the "entry" to
the behavior's actions.

We'll name our file `tiktok.js` and add the basic elements needed to define
our behavior:

```javascript
/* src/site/tiktok.js */
import { Behavior } from "../lib/behavior";

class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

The next step we need to take is to include our new behavior into the
`src/site/index.js` module, like so:

```javascript
/* Other video behaviors */
import { TikTokVideoBehavior } from "./tiktok";

const siteBehaviors = [
  /* Other video behaviors */
  TikTokVideoBehavior,
];

export default siteBehaviors;
```

### The `isMatch()` method

Next we define an `isMatch` method for our `TikTokVideoBehavior` class. This
method checks whether the behavior should run on the current page. Let's use a
regular expression to match against the current path:

```javascript
class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  static isMatch() {
    const pathRegex = /https:\/\/(www\.)?tiktok\.com\/@.+\/video\/\d+/;
    return window.location.href.match(pathRegex);
  }
}
```

Note that the `isMatch` method is `static`, meaning it is defined on the class
itself. When this function returns true, our code in the `Symbol.asyncIterator`
method will run.

### Finding each comment thread

We're now ready to run behaviors on TikTok video pages. browsertrix-behaviors
relies on [XPath][xpath] queries to find DOM nodes and interact with them.
After looking through the page's HTML, you'll see that the comment threads all
live inside an element whose classname corresponds with its element type
followed by `CommentListContainer`.

[xpath]: https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_intro.asp

An XPath query that looks for `div` elements with a similar class, looks
something like this:

```
//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]
```

Let's define a constant to reference these queries:

```javascript
const Q = {
  commentListContainer: "//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]",
}
```

In order to find an element via XPath, we import a function from the
`src/lib/utils.js` module:

Next, we expand the `Symbol.asyncIterator` method like so:

```javascript
class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    console.log("[LOG] List Container", commentList);
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

For now we're just logging out the result returned by the query.

## üèÅ Checkpoint: Testing our code so far

Let's test the pieces we've built so far in the browser. At this point your
`src/site/tiktok.js` module should look something like this:

```javascript
import { Behavior } from "../lib/behavior";
import { xpathNode } from "../lib/utils";

const Q = {
  commentListContainer: "//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]"
};

export const BREADTH_ALL = Symbol("BREADTH_ALL");

export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  static get name() {
    return "TikTokVideo";
  }

  static isMatch() {
    const pathRegex = /https:\/\/(www\.)?tiktok\.com\/@.+\/video\/\d+/;
    return window.location.href.match(pathRegex);
  }

  constructor() {
    super();
  }

  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    console.log("[LOG] List Container", commentList);
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

We'll build what we have so far via the `build-dev` script defined in
`package.json`. Make sure you have `yarn` installed as well as the project's
dependencies by running:

```
$ npm install -g yarn
$ yarn install
```

Next, we build our behaviors in development mode:

```
$ yarn run build-dev
```

This will compile and output our behaviors into `dist/behaviors.js`. We can
copy this code and run it in our browser to test behaviors directly. Make sure
you're viewing a [TikTok Video][tiktok-video], and we can test our code in
Chrome for example by following these steps:

[tiktok-video]: https://www.tiktok.com/@webbstyles/video/7143026261693123882

>
> _**TODO:** Record video outlining this process_
>

1. Open the Developer Tools
1. Click the `Sources` tab
1. In the left sidebar, open the `Snippets` tab
1. Click the `+ New Snippet` button
1. Build the development output via `yarn run build-dev`
1. Copy the output from `dist/index.js`
    - Running `cat dist/index.js | pbcopy` on Linux/MacOS will copy the contents to your clipboard.
1. Paste the contents in the new Snippet
1. At the bottom of the window click the "Play" button or press `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`

Our code is now loaded into the browser, and we can interact with it directly.
In order to run our new behvaior, open the `Console` tab in the Developer Tools
and run the following code:

```javascript
self.__bx_behaviors.run({
  autofetch: false,
  autoplay: false,
  autoscroll: false,
  siteSpecific: true
});
```

A few outputs should appear in your console that look like the following:

```
> {data: 'Starting Site-Specific Behavior: TikTokVideo', type: 'debug'}
> [LOG] List Container <div class="tiktok-...-DivCommentListContainer ...">‚Ä¶</div>
> {data: 'Waiting for behaviors to finish', type: 'debug'}
> {data: 'TikTok Video Behavior Complete', type: 'info'}
> {data: {state: {}, msg: 'done!'}, type: 'info'}
> {data: 'All Behaviors Done for https://www.tiktok.com/@webbstyles/video/7143026261693123882', type: 'debug'}
```

## ‚è¨ Scrolling through comments

Since we've identified the element containing the video's comemnts, we can now
write an XPath query that matches against them. This query is very similar to
the one we're using for the `commentListContianer`, with one notable difference:

```javascript
const Q = {
  commentListContainer: "//div[contains(@class, 'CommentListContainer')]",
  commentItemContainer: "div[contains(@class, 'CommentItemContainer')]",
};
```

Note that there's no `//` prepended to this query, which is specifically used to
match against the _entire_ node structure recursively from the root. While this
is useful for identifying our `CommentListContainer`, it is less appropriate
when defining a query which needs to target specific nodes or‚Äî in the case of
the new `CommentItemContainer` query‚Äî is intended for a helper function that
utilizes it with other parameters.

### The `iterChildMatches` helper function

Let's now import the `iterChildMatches` function from our utils module:

```javascript
import { xpathNode, iterChildMatches } from "../lib/utils";
```

This function takes a query just as `xpathNode` does, along with a parent node
that specifies where we'd like to search. The result is an iterator that looks
for the next element that matches the query and also _waits_ for a new one
before exhausting its search. This allows us to "infinitely scroll" if you will
by matching against both the existing elements and _potential ones_ that may
appear as a result of scrolling or other UI behaviors.

We can now generate this list and iterate through it using an async `for` loop:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      // ... do something with each comment
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

### Using `scrollIntoView`

Now that we're iterating through each comment, we can call the `scrollIntoView`
method to scroll through them. This method takes a set of options that the base
`Behavior` class provides for us:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

### Using `yield` and `this.getState`

We're now scrolling through our comments, but the `asyncIterator` we've written
for our behavior does not `yield` any results other than at the end when it has
completed. This can cause issues down the line, specifically for the
[ArchiveWeb.page][archivewebpage] extension which relies on the ability to pause
and resume site behaviors.

[archivewebpage]: https://github.com/webrecorder/archiveweb.page

Additionally, our behavior isn't logging any results or accumulating totals as
it crawls through the page. We can resolve this by using the `getState` method
defined in the `Behavior` base class:

```javascript
// in the async* [Symbol.asyncIterator] method
for await (const item of commentItems) {
  item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
  yield this.getState("View thread", "threads");
}
```

Our behavior now yields a result each time we scroll to a comment, and the
extension can now pause and resume the scrolling behavior.

### üìñ Expanding comment threads

Since we're able to identify each comment, we can now look for specific parts of
the element like buttons that perform actions on the page. Let's define a new
method called `expandThread`. This method will take a comment item and look for
the `View more replies` button, which we identify with the following query:

```javascript
const Q = {
  // ...
  viewMoreReplies: ".//p[contains(@class, 'ReplyActionText')]",
}
```

Next for our `expandThread Method`:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* expandThread(item) {
    const viewMore = xpathNode(Q.viewMoreReplies, item);
    if (!viewMore) return;
    // ... do something with the "View more repleis" button
  }
  // ...
}
```

As you can see, we've targetted the "View more replies" button with our query
using `xpathNode`; note that it also takes a "parent" argument that specifies
where to look. Our new method then checks whether or not the button exists
before continuing on. Let's import a handy function that will both scroll the
button into the view as well as click it after a provided amount of time:

```javascript
import { xpathNode, iterChildMatches, scrollAndClick } from "../lib/utils";
//                                    ^---- new import
```

We can now use `scrollAndClick` in our new method as well as `this.getState` to
mark our progress:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* expandThread(item) {
    const viewMore = xpathNode(Q.viewMoreReplies, item);
    if (!viewMore) return;
    await scrollAndClick(viewMore, 500);
    yield this.getState("Expand thread", "expandedThreads");
  }
  // ...
}
```

Finally, let's add our new method to the `Symbol.asyncIterator` method:

```javascript
export class TikTokVideoBehavior extends Behavior {
  // ...
  async* [Symbol.asyncIterator]() {
    const commentList = xpathNode(Q.commentListContainer);
    const commentItems = iterChildMatches(Q.commentItemContainer, commentList);
    for await (const item of commentItems) {
      item.scrollIntoView(this.scrollOpts);
      yield* this.expandThread(item);
    }
    yield "TikTok Video Behavior Complete";
  }
}
```

Note that we use the `yield*` keyword in order to yield each result of the
`expandThread` method one at a time. This maintains our fine-grained control
over pausing and resuming the behavior.
